# Personal Website Project - Rough Draft

## Core Goals
- A personal portfolio/brand website.
- Aesthetic inspiration: https://shud.in/ (Minimalist, vertical menu bar, simple text, blur transitions).
- Performance: Must be "snappy" (SPA feel, no page reload delays).
- Mobile responsive: Critical priority.

## Site Structure (Pages)
1. **About**: General bio.
2. **Projects/Experiences**: Portfolio showcase.
3. **Essays**: Blog/writing section. file structure should support adding new articles with pictures, and articles should load in the website smoothly and cleanly. use mdx
4. **YouTube**:
   - A grid layout of videos.
   - Description text: "I have a small youtube channel I keep up which consists mainly of covers and video essays…"
   - my channel is "willybasterra"

## Navigation & Layout
- **Vertical Menu Bar**: Similar to shud.in.
- **Socials**: Icons (X, YouTube, GitHub, LinkedIn) placed at the bottom of the menu bar (Reference: richardpilnick.com).
- **Links Section**: A dropdown menu containing external links (Strava, Goodreads, etc.).

## Visual/Creative Elements
- **Blur Transitions**: Smooth transitioning between pages.
- **Dithered Art**: A fixed overlay png at the bottom of the screen that does not move when scrolling. I can provide a file for this. 

## Tech Stack Preferences
- Next.js, should run with npm run dev
