A couple of weeks ago, walking through the dirty halls of my frat, my right eardrum burst. I’d heard of this happening to people, and had always imagined a violent experience involving a lot of pain and much clutching of the head, but in reality it was nothing like that.

That’s not to say it wasn’t disturbing. I’m no biology major, but I knew the instant I felt a cold and slimy liquid moving from inside my ear to outside my ear that something wasn’t right. I jammed the tip of my finger in my ear to confirm, and it came out glistening with a cloudy puss. That’s not nice to read, so imagine how it felt.

Strangely, the burst came as a relief. Since I’d gotten back to school from winter break, I’d had a piercing infection in my right ear, which had turned my skull into a steaming pressure cooker. When the eardrum burst, it released that built up pressure, and so I was almost glad it happened. I even realized I could pinch my nose shut and hear the whoosh of air blowing out of my ear, which was kind of fun. More than anything, though, it was the first time in months that my head didn’t feel like it was underwater.

See, this burst hadn’t come out of nowhere. It started two years ago, when I mentioned to my Mom that, hey, either these earbuds are broken or I can’t hear anything out of my right ear. A trip to the doctor revealed a faulty eustachian tube – prone to sulking shut – trapping fluid in my middle ear and blocking out half the sound that hit my right eardrum.

There is no real cure for Eustachian tube dysfunction, only potential treatments, and the couple of things the doctor tried while I was still at home only worked to put the problem off, rather than resolve it. Before I knew it, I was off to college with one and a half functioning ears. Parties were where I noticed it the most, the loud music combining with my deficient hearing to really put my poor lip reading skills to the test. Every laugh and whispered flirtation was blurred into a haze of half-heard sounds, and I soon became a talented practitioner of the smile-and-nod. Airplane travel turned into a special brand of medieval torture – when the pilot would announce “twenty minutes until landing,” I would brace myself, clutch the arm rests in a sweaty death grip, and endure the lovely feeling of having my eyeballs threaten to pop out of my head like champagne corks. In my daily life, I developed the posture of a curious dog, forever tilting my good ear toward the world.

When my eardrum burst, I finally got a break from all this – a literal release from months of pressure. Just as I began to savor the new lightness in my head, though, a newcomer intruded. Initially a faint echo, soon a permanent and pervasive beeping developed, impossible to ignore. I looked up the symptoms of an eardrum burst, and there it was: Tinnitus. Could clear up in a couple of weeks. Could be with me for the rest of my life. A coin flip of cosmic proportions.

I keep picturing it like this: A warm sunrise peeking through the window of a beachfront cabana on some far-flung island. The crisp smell of ocean air, me and the love of my life cocooned in the warm hug of white cotton sheets. I look up at her, at peace with the world, her face smooth, serene, and then I remember the beeping in my right ear, like a nagging third wheel. It’s there, it’s always been there, it never stops. Beeeeeeeeeeeeep. Me, the love of my life, and the relentless beep. Holy fuck.

The noise is annoying – that much is undeniable – but, honestly, it’s not the noise that scares me – it’s the permanence. From one moment to the next, I acquired this lifetime companion, and now it sits like a little devil on my shoulder, except instead of leading me into temptation it just whispers morsels of existential dread.

*You’re stuck like this forever*, the beep seems to say.

*No escape!* it taunts.

*What are you going to do with your life?*

At first, I tried to tune it out. Went to class, did my homework, stressed about internships. But when the lights would come off at night and I would shut my eyes to go to sleep, the beep would start to whisper again. An ever present *memento mori*.

I found the tinnitus was getting to me. I’d sit in class – say, during a particularly dense Theory of Computing lecture – and the moment my mind dared to wander, the tinnitus would yank me out, whispering uninvited questions: What am I doing here? Why am I learning this? Why am I trying? Even in the midst of conversations with friends, or on FaceTime with my parents, my focus would split. I’d nod along, laugh when I was supposed to, all the while losing myself in the relentless hum. The sound was siphoning my will, making every moment feel desperately empty.

Desperate for relief or even distraction, I found myself grasping for anything that might reframe what I was feeling. If this sound was here to stay, I needed to understand it, or at least understand myself in relation to it. I happened, at the time, to be reading Eric Weiner’s *The Socrates Express: In Search of Life Lessons From Dead Philosophers*, recommended by a lovely ex-girlfriend who I no longer speak to. Anyway, when I reached the chapter titled “How to Listen Like Schopenhauer,” it, for obvious reasons, piqued my interest, but I could never have expected what it ultimately delivered: a radical shift in perspective. Weiner described Schopenhauer’s cheerful view on existence: that life is a constant struggle driven by the insatiable force he called the "will," which causes endless desire and inevitable suffering (yikes). Within this bleak outlook, though, Schopenhauer also offered an escape, of sorts – a reprieve found in the art of listening.

Schopenhauer describes ‘true listening’ as listening and making no demands of the thing we are listening to, being open to the possibility of aesthetic delight without harboring expectations. This could be listening to music, conversation, the sound of passing cars - or maybe even tinnitus. For Schopenhauer, true listening could cut through the clamor of everyday life. When we truly listen, we cease to be distressed but neither are we happy – such distinctions vanish. By listening deeply, we are granted a break from the suffering inherent in our striving. As Eric Weiner describes it:

> “A Buddhist would say we are not attached to the music but nor are we detached from it. A Christian mystic would say we maintain a ‘holy indifference’ toward it…True listening demands we postpone judgement.”

Talk to me, Weiner. I loved what I was hearing. For weeks, the unyielding, high-pitched whine of my tinnitus had sunk me deeper into despair. Yet here, in the wisdom of Schopenhauer, and echoed by Weiner, I was urged to pause, to simply let the sound be. In that very act of surrender, I discovered the radical possibility that my torment could transform into a kind of comfort.

It was not the first time I’d heard Weiner mention religion. The ideas I was reading from Schopenhauer, I realized, were extremely similar to ideas I’d read a couple of months earlier in another book by Weiner, *Man Seeks God*. Instead of dead philosophers, *Man Seeks God* explores a variety of religions, spanning from Islam and Christianity all the way to Raëlianism, a UFO-based religion. After reading the chapter on Schopenhauer in *The Socrates Express*, I grabbed my copy of *Man Seeks God* and began flipping through the heavily underlined pages I’d annotated only months before. I quickly found in my notes a variety of takeaways from different chapters:

* **Islam:** To surrender, not as defeat but as an act of trust. Accepting that every experience, no matter how painful, is part of a greater tapestry.
* **Catholicism:** To live with grace – embracing the challenges of life as opportunities for compassion and growth.
* **Buddhism:** To be fully present: inhabiting each moment with mindfulness, sitting in the pause before judgement. When you’re with a candle flame, you become the candle flame.

…and so on.

Schopenhauer urged us to listen, I realized, in the same way that most religions urged us to live. I’d go as far as to say, in my extremely light reading of Schopenhauer and complete, unabashed, confidence, that music was, in a way, Schopenhauer’s religion, and that true listening was his practice. At its essence, it is a form of gratitude, demanding that we postpone judgment and just be. When we listen like this, hearing without judging, says Schopenhauer, we “feel positively happy.” Music, for him, was a religion in itself – a practice that required no demands, only an openness to what is.

So, back to the tinnitus. Armed with this array of wisdom, I took another look at my situation. What I found was that my tinnitus had started to sing a different song. Sure, it was still annoying. It would be much cooler if the sound playing in my ear at all times was my Spotify playlist on shuffle rather than a high pitched beeping. But I’d come to realize that I could change how I looked at the tinnitus. Rather than a curse, it gradually transformed into a kind of mantra, an invitation to pause. I learned to let the sound flow over me, surrendering to its tone, and I stopped permitting it from sucking me out of the present moment. When I would hear it in the background of a conversation, I would smile to myself, remembering how it had angered me just days earlier and noting how it made me feel now – grateful. Grateful that I had been forced to confront not just the incessant noise in my ears but also the quiet space in my soul where fear and frustration had taken root. I learned that the key wasn’t to wage war, not to cling desperately to the silence I used to have or the silence I would never have again, but rather to find a way to harmonize with my new companion. I learned to surrender to the sound – if only as a tiny step toward surrendering to life itself.

And then, as if in retribution for my existential crisis and dramatic quasi-religious rabbit hole, the next week I got some ear drops from the doctor and on the first use, the tinnitus vanished. I still had issues with my ear, but the tinnitus was gone, just like that. A nice punchline, I think. Maybe it wasn't so serious after all.
